# WindowShuffler

GUI and keyboard friendly window arranger for the budgie and mate desktop

## Description
WindowShuffler is a window placement add-on. Click a window and subsequently click a tile in the grid, the window moves to the corresponding position on the screen. Shift-click two tiles will make the window span the two. Shift-click does not need to be on two tiles next to each other; cross- selection and spanning multiple tiles is possible.
Options include: quick-grid all windows into the current grid, take a snapshot of current layout, reset to snapshot.
The "extension" comes with a list of shortcuts, which can be called by pressing [ i ].

## Set up
- Make sure all of the following dependencies are installed: wmctrl, xdotool, python3-gi-cairo, python3-cairo.
- Copy all icons (all .svg files) to /usr/share/pixmaps
- Store all code files in one and the same diretory
- Run the wrapper `matrix_wrapper` from either a shortcut or a hotcorner. Running the wrapper again toggles the grid.

## Limitations
- Some windows have a fixed size, they cannot be resized.
- Some windows have a minimum size, they cannot be resized below their minimum size.
